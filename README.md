MMORPG Inventory & Player System

This project is an object-oriented C++ implementation that models an MMORPG-style character system, focusing on inventory management and player interactions. The key components of this project include:

Items: Basic objects with attributes such as name, weight, and type.

Inventory: A 2D vector storing item objects, simulating an inventory grid system.

Player: Each player has a name and an associated inventory.

Guild: A collection of players, facilitating interactions such as moving players between guilds (for testing purposes).
